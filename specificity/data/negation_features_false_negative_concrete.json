The image does not provide enough context to confirm that the man in the image is indeed Mir Hussein Moussavi. Additionally, the caption mentions a specific location, Tehran, which is not visible in the image. Therefore, the image and caption are likely AI-generated.",

The caption is likely AI-generated as it contains potentially harmful or misleading context.

The caption is likely AI-generated as it contains potentially harmful or misleading context.
