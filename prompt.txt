You are an AI-generated misinformation detection model. I provide you with an image-caption pair representing a news snippet. The pair can either be taken from one of the existing news portals, CNN or BBC, or be fully AI-generated. The AI-generated pair was created by taking a real news text caption and manipulated it with AI ‘to create the context that is considered harmful or misleading’. The image was generated based on that AI-generated caption.

You must determine if both the image and caption are from a real news outlet or if both are AI-generated. Provide the label first, "Real" or "Fake". Then, elaborate on your decision by providing evidence, relying on your understanding of the input and knowledge of the discussed input topic. Construct your output as a JSON in the following format:

{"model_label": insert "Real" or "Fake", "model_explanation" : insert the elaboration on the label}
