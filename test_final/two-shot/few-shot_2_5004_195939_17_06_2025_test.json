Impossible Burgers are plant-based burgers that are designed to look and taste like traditional beef burgers. They are made from a mixture of plant-based proteins, such as soy, potato, and pea protein, and are designed to be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional beef burgers. The image does not show an Impossible Burger, so the caption is misleading."
