They are miniaturized satellites that are typically 10x10x10 cm in size and are designed to be launched into space in groups. These small satellites can perform a variety of tasks, including Earth observation, communication, and scientific research. They are often used by universities, research institutions, and private companies due to their lower cost and ease of deployment. CubeSats have gained popularity in recent years as they offer a more accessible and cost-effective way to conduct space research and technology development."
