However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The image shows a person with red hair holding a sign with the text 'RATALITY ECONOMIC PROJECT' and a red airplane. The sign is likely a reference to the Rationality Econonomic Project, which is a research organization that focuses on the study of human decision-making. The presence of the sign and the airplane in the image does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim made in the caption. Therefore, the image and caption are both AI-generated and not factual."
